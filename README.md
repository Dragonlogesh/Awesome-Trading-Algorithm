# Awesome-Trading-Algorithm
This algorithm takes a daily position on the SPY ETF by indirectly predicting the change in price through the put/call ratio. For this project, it is done by implementing machine learning techniques on Sofien Kaabar's put/call ratio trading strategy.

I recommend that you transfer this folder into google drive and launch "runMe.ipynb" with google colab. This will minimize any errors you will encounter. 

Thanks for using my algorithm!
